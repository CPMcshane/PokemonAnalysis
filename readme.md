# Overview

I wanted to test and experiment with a data science program in order to give myself

more knowledge and ability in the area. To achieve this purpose I found a free dataset and

performed some analysis on the data.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio to code and debug the program and I used github for source control

I used the python programming language and the modules Numpy and Pandas

# Useful Websites

Websites that I used to help while progamming
* [Sololearn](https://www.sololearn.com/)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)

# Future Work

* I want to find the average health
* I want to be able to find the max, min, and average health of each pokemon type
* I want to add bar graphs to the program
